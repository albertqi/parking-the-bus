# Lead Lockdown: The Effectiveness of "Parking the Bus" in English Football

## Kelsey Chen, Helen Xiao, and Albert Qi

### Spring 2025

In the game of association football, what strategies prove to be effective? For example, when ahead late in a match, should teams opt to park to bus, or is the best defense is a good offense? Football is a low-scoring game, meaning each goal is of utmost importance. With just one goal, the dynamic of a entire game can easily shift from one side to the other, especially within the last 15 minutes. So, what strategies should teams adopt near the end of a match? Specifically, should Premier League teams park the bus when leading late in a match?

To answer these questions, we utilize the Hudl StatsBomb dataset and look at the 2015-2016 Premier League season. Within this event-level dataset, we analyze each match and determine whether or not there is a decline in offensive intent before and after the 75th minute. If there is, then we label a team during that match as having "parked the bus". By comparing the results in matches where teams park the bus to that in matches where teams do not park the bus, we ultimately show that parking the bus is not very effective, although it does have use cases in certain scenarios (e.g., knockout stages).
